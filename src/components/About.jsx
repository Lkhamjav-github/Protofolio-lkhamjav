                                When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me
                                hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the
                                journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can
                                follow me on Twitter where I share tech-related bites and
                                build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
